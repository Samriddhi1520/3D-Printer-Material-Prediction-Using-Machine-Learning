# 3D-Printer-Material-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A Flask web application that detects potential 3D printing faults using real-time sensor data and predicts the most suitable printing material. Integrates a machine learning model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, Naive Bayes) for accurate predictions, reducing waste and improving print reliability.
